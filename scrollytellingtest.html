              <strong>Though widespread social acceptance</strong> of the LGBTQ+ community appears in many ways to be on the rise, one aspect is facing a notable decline: the availability of in-person queer meeting spaces. In an attempt to combat isolation, a group of Boston community organizers and librarians are establishing the QT Library, set to open in 2025.

                QT Library stands for Queer and Trans Library, indicating both its intended readership and the type of books in their collection. Queer literature has recently come under fire by a small number 0f very vocal legislators and advocates who wish to have books like Gender Queer and All Boys Aren’t Blue removed from local and school libraries.

                In Massachusetts, this charge is primarily led by Massachusetts Informed Parents, which urges parents to submit challenges against books on its Parent Advisory Book List. Of the 203 books on the list, 185 of them—91%—are listed because they contain LGBTQ+ content. The other 9% are listed for heterosexual sexual content, including “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Bluest Eye.” Some are also criticized for portraying violence. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Book bans can be harmful to queer youth, who often have severely limited access to unsurveilled, accessible ways to explore their own identities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Preliminary data from the American Library Association suggests that book challenges may be on the decline from 2023, but they remain far above 2020 levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The greatest number of books were challenged in Texas and Florida. However, bans were not limited to the Southern United States; the Northeast faced plenty of censorship attempts of its own.

            <p>
                Massachusetts is about in the middle of the other Northeastern states, both in actual number of books challenged and in challenges per capita. In the past 5 years, across all Massachusetts public school districts, 70 books have been challenged. Most of the state’s 291 districts declined to remove any books, but 5 districts unshelved at least one title, and 5 more partially restricted access to a book. These districts were Abington, Ludlow, Marblehead, Medfield, Melrose, North Attleborough, Sandwich, Westwood, Wrentham, and Wilmington.

            <p>
                One third of challenges were concentrated among a small number of books, mostly dealing with gender and sexuality. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Boston Public Schools did not remove any books from shelves in response to challenges.

                Like other libraries, the QT Library isn’t just about books. It’s also about other forms of information access (like the Internet and the guidance of librarians), and about being a safe, no-cost place for patrons. For queer people seeking to spend time with other queer people, those can be all too rare.
            </p>
           <p>
            “Most queer spaces in this country are bars and clubs,” said Jake Stepansky, one of four board members of the QT Library. “They're centered around alcohol, which—as much as I personally love a queer bar—makes them exclusionary to all kinds of groups of people.”
           </p>
           <p>
            He’s right—queer bars far outnumber other designated queer spaces. But their numbers are dwindling too. Boston currently has 11 queer bars. Since 1970, at least 29 have closed. 
           </p>
           <p>
            It also has three non-bar LGBTQ+ community spaces: the Boston Alliance of Gay and Lesbian Youth, the Hope Center, and Gay and Lesbian Social Services. Of those, just one has open drop-in hours, and those are limited to people age 22 and under. 
           </p>
           <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=165jg21qP24uniAgVbSJ4ed70JMBn7uc&ehbc=2E312F" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
           <p>
            The QT Library will therefore provide a unique service for LGBTQ+ people by opening its doors without barriers such as age restrictions, entry fees, or requiring membership in a particular organization. 
           </p>
           <p>
            LGBTQ+ libraries are rare, but some do exist in other U.S. cities. The oldest example is the John Wilcox Jr. library in Philadelphia, which has operated since 1976. It has a collection of over 14,000 books, and operates programs such as peer support groups and trans-friendly tailoring. 
           </p>
           <p>
            As the QT Library continues to operate, the founders likewise aim to provide social services, making it “a place that you could vote or a place that you could apply for a name change,” according to Stepansky.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another queer library is the Quatrefoil library in Minneapolis, which opened in 1986 and loans out over 25,000 resources including books, DVDs, and zines. Events hosted there range from book clubs and arts and crafts nights to activist collectives. Stepansky hopes to invite a similarly wide-ranging group of people to visit the QT Library.
           </p>
           <p>
            “There was a real big shift from  our earliest conception to our our current, and I would say forever, conception: we used to say this library is a space for the quiet gays.” Since then, they’ve moved beyond a binary conception of loud versus quiet people. “Everybody contains multitudes—sometimes you need quiet, and sometimes you need noise. We intend this to be a space for anybody when they find themselves needing space.”
           </p>
           <p>
            That could include queer youth, queer elders, family members of queer people, and organizations looking for a place to hold a meeting. 
           </p>
           <p>
            Massachusetts does have one other group safeguarding access to LGBTQ+ literature: the Sexual Minority Archives in Holyoke. It contains historical materials, literature, art, and the personal research library of now-deceased LGBTQ+ activist and writer Leslie Feinberg. Its collection can only be accessed by making an appointment. 
           </p>
           <p>
            The QT Library’s collection currently contains over 5,000 books, which will be available for the public to borrow when the organization moves into a physical space in the upcoming year. Rather than being shelved according to the Dewey Decimal system, or by author’s last name, they are sorted by author and subject identity. Their digital search system “pretty granularly breaks down many, many different axes of identity,” Stepansky said. This includes not just queer labels but also people who are marginalized in other ways, including race and disability. 
           </p>
           <p>
            “We, from day one, have wanted our collection to represent the varied and vast diversity of the queer and trans community,” Stepansky said. “We want books written by marginalized authors and featuring marginalized characters to be a celebrated core piece of our collection.”
           </p>
           <p>
            When deciding what books to include or exclude, the QT Library is currently operating on a case-by-case basis. They weigh criteria such as historical importance to the queer community, the way marginalized people are regarded by the author in the text, popular demand for the book, and sometimes gut instincts by the library’s curators. 
           </p>
           <p>
            For Stepansky, a high priority to include in the collection was the Heartstopper graphic novels, which were first published online in 2016 and have since been adapted into a TV show. 
           </p>
           <p>
            “I was really moved by the tenderness of it, the joy of it, the fact that it was aimed at younger audiences, the fact that it didn't end with somebody getting hit by a bus or dying as much of the queer media that I personally had experienced as a kid did,” Stepansky said. 
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, that was part of what inspired him to found QT Library.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I was very moved by this show,” he said, “and I was constantly trying to share it with people in my life. And I realized that if I could do one thing for the rest of my life, it would be to share queer and trans stories, media, culture content with people that I love and care about as a way of bringing joy into their life.”
